                        <p>Babies, who lived and developed in their mother's womb for 9 months, make reflexive movements in the pool water. Through various playful exercises in the arms of their mom or dad and under the guidance of our coach, they unknowingly:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>activate their muscles</li>
                            <li>strengthen their immune system</li>
                            <li>develop antibodies</li>
                            <li>become less susceptible to illnesses.</li>
                            <li>learn to control their bodies by changing positions and postures.</li>
                            <li>release their energy, resulting in calmer sleep.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Additionally, as a parent, you get to spend creative time with your child, developing stronger emotional bonds and discovering that your child will learn to swim in the simplest and most fun way, completely spontaneously with your participation. We don't teach your baby; you teach them lessons of love. At the same time, through the group, they develop their socialization skills.</p>
